A WebGL 3D structural editor for biochemical modeling. [The wiki][] has some more information, 
but it's mostly to keep my thoughts somewhat organized. Also, check out the latest (incomplete) [demo][].

 - Version 0.2: use CSG.js to allow the user to type the geometry they want
 - Version 0.3: visual helpers (?)
