## Development

To ensure that CoffeeScript files get compiled as you edit them and to get
a nice test web server, run:

    gem install asdf
    make develop

## Roadmap

 - Version 0.1: look at a cube and manipulate the camera
 - Version 0.2: use CSG.js to allow the user to type the geometry they want
 - Version 0.3: visual helpers (?)
