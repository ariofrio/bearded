# Codename: Bearded

A WebGL 3D structural editor for biochemical modeling. [The wiki][] has some more information, 
but it's mostly to keep my thoughts somewhat organized. Also, check out the latest (incomplete) [demo][].

## Development

To ensure that CoffeeScript files get compiled as you edit them and to get
a nice test web server, run:

    gem install asdf
    make develop

## Roadmap

 - Version 0.1: look at a cube and manipulate the camera
 - Version 0.2: use CSG.js to allow the user to type the geometry they want
 - Version 0.3: visual helpers (?)
